                Hello, as you can see above, my name is Miranda D'Asto.
                I am currently working on my bachelors for IT management. 
                I am on track to graduate in April of 2021. In the meantime, I am
                taking a course in coding and full-stack web development
                offered by the University of Utah to supplement my education.
                <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy going to my studio where I train on
                aerial apparatuses such as hammock, lyra (hoop), and silks. I 
                have also recently begun taking up horse back riding (again) on 
                the weekends. I lead an exciting life full of education and
                adventure! I am very happy where I am, and very excited for my
                future. 
            </p>
