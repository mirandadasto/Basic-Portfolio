                        Hello, as you can see above, my name is Miranda D'Asto.
                        I am currently working on my bachelors for IT management. 
                        I am on track to graduate in April of 2021. In the meantime, I am
                        taking a course in coding and full-stack web development
                        offered by the University of Utah to supplement my education.
                        <br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy going to my studio where I train on
                        aerial apparatuses such as hammock, lyra (hoop), and silks. I 
                        have also recently began taking up horse back riding (again) on 
                        the weekends. I lead an exciting life full of education and
                        adventure! I am very happy where I am, and very excited for my
                        future. 
                    </p>
